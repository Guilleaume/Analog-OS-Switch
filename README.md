ANALOG-OS (v1.2p) - UNIVERSAL GUITAR SIGNAL ARCHITECTURE
"We don't change the pickup. We change the world the pickup lives in."
===============================================================================

[INTRODUCTION]
Analog-OS is a modular signal architecture designed to maximize the potential 
of any electric guitar. It optimizes the electronic infrastructure through 
high-quality signal paths and precise electrical load management.

The system functions as a "Multi-Boot" environment, allowing players to 
instantly toggle between different "tonal operating systems" (wiring logics) 
without physical reconstruction of the circuit.

[CORE SYSTEM LOGIC]
The architecture is platform-independent and scales from vintage 2-conductor 
to modern 4-conductor setups.

1. THE ANALOG-OS SWITCH (DUAL-STACK ENGINE)
   Using DPDT logic to toggle the fundamental circuit behavior:
   - 50s WIRING: Authentic vintage interaction between Volume and Tone.
   - MODERN WIRING (v1.1+): Stable signal with integrated Treble-Bleed.

2. MODULAR EXTENSIONS (ANALOG-OS-DESIGN)
   The framework supports various high-end modules depending on hardware:
   - 4-CONDUCTOR OPTIMIZATION: Seamless integration of Spin-a-Split, 
     Out-of-Phase, or complex Coil-Tapping.
   - 2-CONDUCTOR ENHANCEMENT: Brings modern sound-shaping to vintage pickups 
     via Capacitor Cascade (v1.2) or Series-Switching.
   - BLENDER-LOGIC: Efficient switching "frees up" potentiometer slots in 
     Strat-style layouts for continuous pickup mixing.

3. INTELLIGENT LOAD CORRECTION (v1.2p)
   Utilizes an ON-OFF-ON toggle for advanced impedance management:
   - CENTER (OFF): Complete Tone-Pot isolation (True Bypass).
   - LOAD CORRECTION: Specifically designed for Single-Coil environments. 
     When in Series-Mode (Quasi-Humbucker), the system corrects the parallel 
     load from 125k back to 250k. This prevents "choking" and delivers a 
     massive, open, and authentic humbucker response.

[HARDWARE & PLANNING]
The modular choice is guided by the guitar's physical constraints:

* SINGLE-CUT (4-POT): Ideal for v1.0-v1.2. Perfect for 4-conductor humbuckers 
  to implement Spin-a-Split or Phase modules.
* TELECASTER (2-POT): Efficient use of space via v1.2p + Series Switching.
* STRATOCASTER: Repurposes existing tone controls into versatile Blending 
  units without adding extra hardware.

[THE PLANNING WORKFLOW]
1. PICKUP WIRING: 4-conductor (maximum versatility) or 2-conductor (vintage). 
   Analog-OS provides dedicated solutions for both.
2. HARDWARE: Choice between Mini-Toggles (optimal for logic switching) or 
   Push-Pull pots (maintaining stock appearance).
